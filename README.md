## What is XBRL?
The e**X**tensible**B**usiness**R**ules**L**anguage is a scheme for labelling data in financial documents with common machine-readable labels.

A **concept** is a label applied to a specific piece of data, like "AccountsPayable" or "AdvertisingExpense". Most concepts come from the US-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) taxonomy.

An XBRL **fact** is a a 3-tuple of (concept, time, value).

## Interesting Concepts
The GAAP taxonomy is large, this is a show big-picture information about a company. These should be useful when comparing data across companies.

[MFAANG_Concepts.json](resources/MFAANG_Concepts.json) contains a union of concepts reported by Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google (Alphabet).

TODO: They all report all 496 of these GAAP concepts, are these all required?
